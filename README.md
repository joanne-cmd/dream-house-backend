# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is  a backend repo that enables a user to:

1. Sign up or Log in
2. Displays to the user a list of all the available houses that are up for rent on the website
3. A user views more details of the house on the “view more” option eg price of the house
4. Allows the user to add a new house available for rent
5. Enables the user to have a look at the previous reviews for the various houses
6.A user can search the house by typing in the location and the house type they would want to search for.

to get the backend  up and running:
- run "bundle install" so to install all the gems in the gemfile
- run "rails s" and the server will be launched on the port: http://127.0.0.1:3000 where the backend will now be running
